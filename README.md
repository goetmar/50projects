# 50 Projects In 50 Days

This is a collection of 50+ mini web projects using HTML, CSS & JavaScript which did as part of a course by Brad Traversy. As this is my implementation of the course, there are changes made to the original contents.

You can find the course here:

- [Repository Link](https://github.com/bradtraversy/50projects50days)

### Project Demo

Follow these steps in order to view the projects:

- Clone this repo
- Open the repo folder with Visual Studio Code
- Install the [Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for VS Code

Then you need to activate live server. The easiest way to do this is to click on `Go Live` from the status bar. You could also right-click an `HTML` file from Explorer Window and click on `Open with Live Server`.

This will launch a local development server with live reload feature on Port:5500 where you can switch between the project folders to view the individual projects.
