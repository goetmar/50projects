        <h1>Wurm Welcome: The Perfect Introduction to Commander</h1>

              When you invite a new player to a game of Commander to familiarize
              them with the format, the question arises: which deck should you
              give them? After all, you want them to have fun. In my experience,
              <i>Baru, Wurmspeaker</i> has everything needed to provide just
              that.
            </p>
            <p>
              First of all, the mono-green color identity keeps it simple.
              Focusing on just one color highlights its strengths and abilities
              without the hassle of balancing mana production. By limiting the
              lands to mostly basics with a few utility lands allows you to
              focus on the fun of casting impactful spells. Fortunately, green's
              spell selection is straightforward: sorceries to draw cards and
              ramp mana, instants to interact with the board, and big creatures
              to win through combat. Ramp is particularly powerful in Commander
              and really enables your game plan of playing expensive spells.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wurms play right into the core mechanics of green, as they are, by
              definition, huge creatures. They lack specific defining traits
              other than their unusually high power and toughness, which leads
              to a variety of unique and sometimes quirky mechanics among
              different wurms. The archetype carries a mysterious flavor, as
              wurms are related to dragons but feel more primal.
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Baru, Wurmspeaker</i> as the commander offers a pump effect
              paired with trample for all your wurms, a powerful buff that's
              always available from the command zone. Combined with an
              affordable mana cost and the ability to generate wurms himself, he
              is a well-designed and effective commander.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ultimately, this deck brings joy by combining green's simple yet
              impactful mechanics with the sheer power and excitement of wurm
              creatures, all tied together by a commander that unites them into
              a combat-focused strategy. If this sounds appealing, give it a try
              yourself or share it with friends new to the format!

              but if you're interested, you can check out my version of the

              trample, which is essential for large creatures. He can also
              generate a 4/4 wurm for 1 green mana, if you have a wurm with base
              power 5 or more in play.</small
