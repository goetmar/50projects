        <h1>Why monogreen wurms is the best deck for new commander players</h1>

              When you invite a new player to a game of Commander to get them
              familiar with the format, the question arises what deck to give
              them. After all, you want them to have fun. In my experience,
              "Baru, Wurmspeaker" has everything you need to provide that.
            </p>
            <p>
              First of all, the mono-green color of the deck keeps it simple.
              Learning to play just one color emphasizes its strengths and
              abilities without having to balance your mana production. Reducing
              the land diversity down to a mix of basics with a few utility
              lands allows you to focus on the fun of casting impactful spells.
              Thankfully, spell selection in green is straight forward: you have
              sorceries to draw cards and ramp up your mana, instants to
              interact with the board and big creatures to win by combat. Ramp
              is very powerful in Commander and really enables your gameplan of
              playing expensive cards.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wurms play right into the core mechanics of green, as they
              themselves are huge cretures by definition. They don't really have
              any defining characteristics other than their unusually large
              bodies, which leads to a variety of unique and sometimes wonky
              mechanics that each wurm brings to the table. The archetype has a
              mysterious flavor to, as wurms are related to dragons but feel
              more primal.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Baru, Wurmspeaker" as the commander offers a pump effect paired
              with trample for all your wurms, which is just a great and strong
              effect to have sitting in the command zone. Together with an
              affordable mana cost and the ability to generate wurms himself, he
              makes for well-designed commander.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ultimately this deck brings joy by combining the simple and strong
              mechanics of green with the sheer power and excitement of wurm
              creatures as the commander glues the two together. If this speaks
              to you, try it out for yourself or share it with friends who are
              new to the format!

              I didn't talk about specific cards in this article, as I wanted to
              keep it more general. If you are interested, you can check out my
              version of the deck here:

              >Baru provides an anthem effect for your wurms and gives them
              trample, which is essential for large creatures. He can also
              generate a 4/4 wurm for 1 green mana, if you have a wurm with base
              power 5 or more in play.</small
